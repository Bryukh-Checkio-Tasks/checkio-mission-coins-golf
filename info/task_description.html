    Nicola trains his mind with anything within reach of his hands.
    He found several coins on his work-desk and came up with a mind game involving them.
</p>

<p>
    You are given several coins.
    Each coin has value from 1 to 9.
    You must write a function that gets a list of the coins as their inputs and
    calculate the smallest amount of money that cannot be paid for with <strong>exact</strong> change (excepting zero).
</p>

<p>
    We have one more rule for this challenge:
    this is a <strong>code golf mission</strong> and your main goal is to make your code as short as possible.
    The shorter your code, the more points you earn.
    Your score for this mission is dynamic and directly related to the length of your code.
    For reference, scoring is based on the number of characters used.
    <strong>300 characters</strong> is the maximum allowable and it will earn you zero points.
    For each character less than 300, you earn 1 point. For example, for 200 character long code earns you 100 points.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Coin values as a list with integers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The smallest amount of money that cannot be paid exactly using these coins as an integer.

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
golf([9, 2, 2, 1]) == 6
golf([1, 1, 1, 1]) == 5
golf([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 16

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This is a classical combinatorial problem.
    You can use itâ€™s mind game for fun, or to program your snack machine.
