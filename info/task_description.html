    Nicola trains his mind with anything at hands. He had several coins and thought up the mind game with them.
</p>

<p>
    You are given several coins. Each coin has value from 1 to 9.
    Write a function that gets a list of coins as its input and calculates the smallest amount of money
    that cannot be paid exactly using these coins (excepting zero).

    We have one more rule for this challenge.
    This is a <strong>code golf mission</strong> and your main goal is to make your code as short as possible.
    The shorter your code, the more points you earn.
    Your score for this mission is dynamic and directly related to the length of your code.
    For reference, scoring is based on the number of characters used.
    <strong>250 characters</strong> is the maximum allowable and it will earn you zero points.
    For each character less than 250, you earn 1 point. For example for 200 character long code earns you 50 points.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Coin values as a list with integers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The smallest amount of money that cannot be paid exactly using these coins as an integer.

    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
golf([10, 2, 2, 1]) == 6
golf([1, 1, 1, 1]) == 5
golf([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 16

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This is a classical combinatorial problem. You can use it's like a mind game.
    Or program your snack machine.
